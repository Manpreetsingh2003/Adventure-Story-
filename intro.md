The world is changing. The once-thriving forests are fading, rivers are drying, and the balance of nature is slipping away. Deep within the Emerald Woods, hidden beyond towering trees and whispering winds, lies an ancient power—The Heart of Nature.

Legends speak of this mystical artifact, said to be the very essence of life itself. It is the pulse of the earth, the force that keeps nature in harmony. But now, the Heart is weakening, and with it, the world is falling into chaos.

You, a brave explorer, have been chosen by the spirits of the forest to embark on a journey to restore the Heart of Nature before it’s too late. The path ahead is unknown, filled with challenges, magical beings, and choices that will shape the fate of the world.
