Despite natureâ€™s resilience, human activities have significantly impacted the environment, leading to:
Deforestation: Cutting down trees for urbanization and agriculture destroys animal habitats and reduces oxygen production.
Pollution: Air, water, and land pollution from industries, vehicles, and waste harm ecosystems and human health.
Climate Change: Excessive greenhouse gas emissions cause rising temperatures, melting glaciers, and extreme weather conditions.
Loss of Biodiversity: Hunting, poaching, and habitat destruction threaten the survival of many plant and animal species.
