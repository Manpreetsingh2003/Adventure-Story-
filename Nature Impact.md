The story leads to two possible endings, depending on the choices made:

The Good Ending: If you successfully heal the land, cleanse the waters, and awaken the elemental spirits, you will restore the Heart of Nature. The forest will thrive again, animals will return, and the world will regain its balance.
The Bad Ending: If you fail to protect nature’s essence, the Heart of Nature will wither away, causing the forest to collapse, rivers to dry, and life to fade into darkness.
This adventure highlights the importance of nature’s balance, the effects of environmental destruction, and the power of a single individual to make a difference.
